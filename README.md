
*CPU SCHEDULING SIMULATOR*

The CPU Scheduling Simulator is a Java-based platform designed to model various CPU scheduling algorithms. Each algorithm possesses distinct traits, and the selection of an appropriate algorithm for a given scenario relies on specific criteria, known as CPU scheduling criteria. Determining the most suitable algorithm involves a comparative assessment of factors like response time, throughput, and average waiting time. The challenge lies in balancing these factors effectively. Our project aims to address this challenge by offering a solution for selecting the most appropriate scheduling algorithm for specific situations.

The Simulator creates an environment enabling users to experimentally evaluate the performance of different algorithms through simulation. Users initiate the program by choosing the scheduling algorithm they wish to simulate. Subsequently, they input the number of processes and associated details for each, such as CPU burst, process ID, priority (if employing priority scheduling), arrival time, and more. The simulation visualizes the process execution, displaying remaining wait or burst times, along with processes in the ready queue. Notably, the project emphasizes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user-friendly and accessible operation.
